## Abstract

```markdown
# What is a good visualization?

We want to define criteria for good a visualization and discuss how we can improve given examples.

We focus on the following questions:
* What is a good visualization?
* Why is it so easy and tempting to create not-so-good visualizations?
* How can we improve our visualizations?

I am curious to learn about your experience! ðŸ™‚
