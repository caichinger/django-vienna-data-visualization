# Effective Data Visualizations!? 📊🤔💡

Talk at Django Vienna meetup.

---

## What is a good visualization? 🤔

---

## It tells your story effectively! ✨

---

## But we always try that anyway... 😶

---

## Do we, really? 🤓

---

Let's ask a different questions.

## How can we improve? 📈
## How can we support our process? ⚙️
## How can we adjust our habits? 🤹

# Effective Data Visualizations? 🤔

# Question-based Visualizations! 💬

A principled approach to crafting graphs.
A set of resources.

---

## Common Approach

1. Dig around in the data
1. Produce some charts
1. Publish visualizations via report/dashboard/web/*

*I did that often enough.*

---

## Question-based Approach

1. Don't look at the data
1. Explicitly identify and express **questions of interest**
1. Craft visualizations that **answer exactly that** question

Consequences:
* **Alignment** on purpose of visualization **before** it is produced
* **Understanding** of the purpose of visualization **after** it is produced

---

I know.

It's obvious.

Yet, there are so many bad visualizations out there...

Because sometimes, there are moments of weakness.

That's okay.

## Three Laws of Effective Visual Communication

1. Have a **clear purpose**
1. **Show** the data **clearly**
1. Make the **message obvious**

Consequence:
* Clear **intention facilitates** better **feedback** to improve if needed
